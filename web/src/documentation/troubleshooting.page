h2. Remote database

h3. RMI error, tries to connect to 127.0.1.1

Under some conditions, the client fails to connect to a remote database because because of network configuration issues. As a workaround, set the following variable before launching the database:

export EXTRA_JVM_ARGS="-Djava.rmi.server.hostname=192.168.0.3"

(replacing 192.168.0.3 with the ip of the machine).
